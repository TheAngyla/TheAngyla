- 👋 Hello there, I’m @TheAngyla.
- 👀 I’m interested in coding and writing.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning some of the basics of Python 2.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything, if I can help I'll try my best to complete the task.
- 📫 How to reach me: do not.
- And most importantly...
- 🦆 I like ducks.
